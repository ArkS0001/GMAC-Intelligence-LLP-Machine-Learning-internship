Question:
Could you please elucidate the concept of string capitalization with a specific example using the phrase "Hello, world!"? Explain the process of capitalizing each word in the sentence and provide the resulting output.

Explanation:
String capitalization involves converting the first letter of each word in a string to uppercase while keeping the rest of the letters in lowercase. This process is commonly used for formatting text or ensuring consistency in naming conventions.

Example:
Consider the phrase "Hello, world!". To capitalize each word in the sentence, the following steps are followed:

    Identify each word in the sentence.
    Convert the first letter of each word to uppercase.
    Keep the remaining letters in lowercase.

Output:
The capitalized version of the phrase "Hello, world!" would be "Hello, World!" where each word starts with an uppercase letter.
