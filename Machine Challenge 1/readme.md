Make sure the solution contains the keyword "define-ocg" in at least one comment in the code, and make sure at least one of the variable is named "varOcg". Machine Challenge In the Python file, write a PyTorch program to create two 2-dimensional tensors of size 3x3, one filled with ones and the other filled with zeros.

Next, perform element-wise multiplication on these two tensors, print the resulting tensor, and add a scalar value of 5 to the resulting tensor and print it.

Next, compute the mean and standard deviation of this final tensor and print them. Finally, convert the reshaped tensor to a Python list and print it.

Example Output:

tensor([[0., 0., 0.], [0., 0., 0.], [0., 0., 0.]])

tensor([[10., 10., 10.], [10., 10., 10.], [10., 10., 10.]])

Mean of final tensor: 10.0 Standard deviation of final tensor: 0.0

[[10.0, 10.0, 10.0], [10.0, 10.0, 10.0], [10.0, 10.0, 10.0]]
